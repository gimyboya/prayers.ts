# Getting Started

## Overview

Prayers.ts is a reactive library for calculating (Islamic) prayer times. It is built with typescript and can be used for both node and the browser.

You can learn more about the rationale behind the project and it's features in the [Why Prayers.ts](./introduction.md#why-this-library) section.

::: warning
Prayers.ts is currently a WIP status. It is already able to make one time calculations but we are still working on the reactive calculations, the API may also change between minor releases.

### Deno

Unlike Node, Deno relies on direct URL imports instead of a package manager like NPM. Prayers.ts is available on [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x). The latest version can be imported like so:

::: tip
The rest of this documentation assumes you are using npm/yarn/pnpm and importing directly from the "prayer.ts" package.
